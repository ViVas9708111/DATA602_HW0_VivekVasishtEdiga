As a Data Scientist with 1.5 years of experience, I have dealt with massive amounts of data that were noisy and time dependent. I have a great time processing the data, studying the relations of the keys within the data, formulating a ML model out of those relations and finally deploying them on a visual dashboard. But I still felt I needed to hone on my Data Science skills and tools. I wanted to refine myself into a reformed Data Scientist, capable of taking the world's toughest data problems, and finding a amicable solution to it. I want to become the top 1% in my field, for which reason I strongly believe DATA602 will help me in reaching my goal.
